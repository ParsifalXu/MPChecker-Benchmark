    """Apply clustering to a projection of the normalized Laplacian.

    In practice Spectral Clustering is very useful when the structure of
    the individual clusters is highly non-convex or more generally when
    a measure of the center and spread of the cluster is not a suitable
    description of the complete cluster. For instance, when clusters are
    nested circles on the 2D plane.

    If affinity is the adjacency matrix of a graph, this method can be
    used to find normalized graph cuts.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <spectral_clustering>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    affinity : {array-like, sparse matrix} of shape (n_samples, n_samples)
        The affinity matrix describing the relationship of the samples to
        embed. **Must be symmetric**.

        Possible examples:
          - adjacency matrix of a graph,
          - heat kernel of the pairwise distance matrix of the samples,
          - symmetric k-nearest neighbours connectivity matrix of the samples.

    n_clusters : int, default=None
        Number of clusters to extract.

    n_components : int, default=n_clusters
        Number of eigenvectors to use for the spectral embedding

    eigen_solver : {None, 'arpack', 'lobpcg', or 'amg'}
        The eigenvalue decomposition strategy to use. AMG requires pyamg
        to be installed. It can be faster on very large, sparse problems,
        but may also lead to instabilities. If None, then ``'arpack'`` is
        used.

    random_state : int, RandomState instance, default=None
        A pseudo random number generator used for the initialization of the
        lobpcg eigenvectors decomposition when eigen_solver == 'amg' and by
        the K-Means initialization. Use an int to make the randomness
        deterministic.
        See :term:`Glossary <random_state>`.

    n_init : int, default=10
        Number of time the k-means algorithm will be run with different
        centroid seeds. The final results will be the best output of n_init
        consecutive runs in terms of inertia. Only used if
        ``assign_labels='kmeans'``.

    eigen_tol : float, default=0.0
        Stopping criterion for eigendecomposition of the Laplacian matrix
        when using arpack eigen_solver.

    assign_labels : {'kmeans', 'discretize'}, default='kmeans'
        The strategy to use to assign labels in the embedding
        space.  There are two ways to assign labels after the Laplacian
        embedding.  k-means can be applied and is a popular choice. But it can
        also be sensitive to initialization. Discretization is another
        approach which is less sensitive to random initialization. See
        the 'Multiclass spectral clustering' paper referenced below for
        more details on the discretization approach.

    verbose : bool, default=False
        Verbosity mode.

    Returns
    -------
    labels : array of integers, shape: n_samples
        The labels of the clusters.

    Notes
    -----
    The graph should contain only one connect component, elsewhere
    the results make little sense.

    This algorithm solves the normalized cut for k=2: it is a
    normalized spectral clustering.
